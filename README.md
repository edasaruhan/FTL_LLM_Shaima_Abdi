##Climate Change Sentiment Analysis Tool
This project focuses on analyzing public sentiment regarding climate change, leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the DistilBERT model. The sentiment analysis tool is designed to categorize text data related to climate change into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, helping to provide insights that align with SDG 13: Climate Action.

#Features
Model: Utilizes the pre-trained distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model from Hugging Face.
Sentiment Analysis: Classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
Custom Dataset: The dataset used for this project was created specifically for analyzing climate change-related sentiments.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
models/: Directory where the fine-tuned model is saved.
